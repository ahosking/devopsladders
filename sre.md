# What is SRE?

SRE, which stands for Site Reliability Engineering, is a discipline and set of practices within the field of software engineering that focuses on creating scalable and highly reliable software systems. SRE was developed at Google to address the challenges of maintaining large, complex, and highly available web services. It combines principles from software engineering and applies them to operations and infrastructure management.

Key characteristics and practices of Site Reliability Engineering include:

Service-Level Objectives (SLOs): SREs define and maintain SLOs, which are specific, quantifiable targets for system reliability. SLOs help teams measure and communicate the level of service quality they aim to achieve and maintain.

Error Budgets: An error budget is the acceptable level of unreliability or downtime that a service can experience without violating its SLO. SREs use error budgets to balance the need for reliability with the need for rapid development and innovation. If a service exceeds its error budget, it triggers a focus on reliability improvements rather than adding new features.

Automation: SRE teams heavily rely on automation for tasks such as provisioning, monitoring, and incident response. Automation helps reduce human error and ensures consistent system management.

Monitoring and Alerting: SREs implement robust monitoring and alerting systems to detect and respond to issues in real-time. Monitoring tools help track the performance and reliability of services.

Incident Management: SREs use well-defined incident management processes to respond to and resolve service disruptions or performance issues quickly. Post-incident reviews are conducted to learn from each incident and make improvements.

Capacity Planning: SREs plan for future growth and traffic by estimating capacity requirements and ensuring that systems can scale to meet demand.

Change Management: SRE teams carefully manage changes to production systems, using practices like canary deployments and gradual rollouts to minimize the risk of introducing issues.

Blameless Post-Mortems: When incidents occur, SREs conduct blameless post-mortems to focus on identifying the root causes and systemic issues rather than assigning blame. This encourages a culture of learning and continuous improvement.

Software Engineering Practices: SREs are often expected to have strong software engineering skills and apply them to the creation of tools, scripts, and software solutions that improve system reliability and automation.

SREs work closely with development teams to ensure that software is designed with reliability in mind from the outset. The goal is to strike a balance between reliability and agility, allowing organizations to innovate and release new features while maintaining high service availability. SRE has become a popular approach in the tech industry, and many organizations have adopted its principles and practices to improve the reliability of their systems.
